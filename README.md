# 👋 Hi there, I'm Levah Emmanuel — Software Engineer | Flutter & Django Developer | Techpreneur 🚀

I'm a passionate and results-driven software engineer with a strong focus on building impactful, scalable solutions. I specialize in **Flutter** for beautiful cross-platform mobile apps and **Django** for robust backend systems and APIs. I love creating applications that solve real-world problems — from ride-hailing and transport management to financial systems and NGO platforms.

## 🚧 Current Projects
- 🚌 **Porta App** – An intercity transport booking and management system for Nigeria (Flutter + Django)
- 🚗 **Bolt Clone** – A ride-hailing app built with Flutter frontend and Django/Node.js backend
- 💡 **Electricity Purchase App** – Real-time prepaid meter recharge, outage alerts, and feedback portal
- 🏦 **Loan Platform** – For peer-to-peer lending, investment tracking, and repayment analytics

## 💼 What I Do
- 🔧 Full-Stack Development (Flutter, Django, Node.js, REST APIs)
- 💳 Payment Integration (Paystack, Flutterwave, OTP-based login)
- 📱 Mobile App UI/UX Design (Clean, responsive, Bolt-style layouts)
- 🧠 Project Architecture & Co-Development (Actively collaborating on several MVPs)
- ✍️ Technical Writing, Documentation, and Deployment (GitHub, Heroku, DigitalOcean)

## 🎯 Goals
- Build scalable tech products for African startups, government agencies, and global users.
- Launch SaaS platforms and faceless YouTube channels for passive income.
- Help NGOs and social impact projects with tailored software solutions.
